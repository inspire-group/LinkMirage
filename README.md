# LinkMirage

In this work, we design LinkMirage, a system that mediates privacy-preserving access to social relationships. LinkMirage takes usersâ€™ social relationship graph as an input, obfuscates the social graph topology, and provides untrusted external applications with an obfuscated view of the social relationship graph while preserving graph utility.
